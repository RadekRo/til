# repeat() 
#### create string by multiplying other string

Using `repeat()` creates a string that is a multiplication 
of the string on which repeat was used. A number between brackets `(num)`says the
method how many times it should multiple the string.

__Example:__

```
const string = 'Aa';
const newString = string.repeat(2);

// Returns:
// newString = 'AaAa'.
```
